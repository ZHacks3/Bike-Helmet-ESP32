Bike Side: 2 push buttons located on the handlebars controlled by an ESP32 and powered by a small lipo battery.
Helmet Side: 2 groups of 3 LEDs located on the back of the helmet, an accelerometer, a small speaker near the ear, also all controlled by an ESP32 and powered by a small lipo.
When the push buttons are pressed, they send a notification to the helmet ESP32 via Bluetooth low energy. The helmet receives this data and flashes the respectable LEDs, as well as turn on a clicking noise on the speaker. This clicking noise is similar to the noise a car makes when their turn signals are on. After this the button can be pressed again to turn off the LEDs and the speaker. The idea was the accelerometer would automatically turn these off, but I was unable to test it while actually biking.
